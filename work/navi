amcl: a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D, uses a particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.
amcl: sample_motion_model_odometry, beam_range_finder_model, likelihood_field_range_finder_model, Augmented_MCL, and KLD_Sampling_MCL.

As currently implemented, this node works only with laser scans and laser maps. It could be extended to work with other sensor data.


base_local_planner:  Using a map, the planner creates a kinematic trajectory for the robot to get from a start to a goal location.
